## We Don’t Track No Cookies

Wondering how this website fares when it comes to privacy and GDPR rules and
regulations?—Good news: It does not use any tracking cookies.

## Your Personal Data is Safe

We do not collect your data. Since we don’t have your data, we cannot share your
data (*d’uh*). However, to make lawyers happy, I want to reiterate that
we will never share your information with anyone without your prior consent.
