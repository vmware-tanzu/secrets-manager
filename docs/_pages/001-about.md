## Hey, This Looks Like a GitBook 📖

Yes, this website is intentionally created like a book. We wanted to make
sure that you have a great experience reading our documentation, and we
believe that following the documentation cover-to-cover as if it were a book
is the best way to learn about **VMware Secrets Manager** (*VSecM*) for
Cloud-Native Apps.

We use a heavily customized version of [the Jekyll GitBook Theme][gitbook-theme]
to achieve this. [You can check the source code for this website on
GitHub][github] to see how that is done.
