**VMware Secrets Manager** *for Cloud-Native Apps* is a successor of 
a project called [**Aegis**][aegis]. The project was [renamed to 
**VMware Secrets Manager** and moved under the **VMware Tanzu** GitHub 
organization][vsecm].

[aegis]: https://github.com/sheildworks/aegis "Aegis"
[vsecm]: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/secrets-manager "VMware Secrets Manager for Cloud-Native Apps"


In the meantime, you can check out the videos that relate to **Aegis**. Aside
from the name, the videos are still relevant. 

> **Replace “Aegis” with “VSecM”**
> 
> When watching the videos remember to replace **Aegis** with **VMware Secrets Manager**,
> and the `aegis` command in **Aegis Sentinel** with the `safe` command in 
> **VSecM Sentinel**. The rest of the content shall still be relevant.
