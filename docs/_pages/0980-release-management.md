## Introduction

This page discusses the release management process for **VMware Secrets Manager**.

If you are responsible for cutting a release, please follow the steps outlined
here.

## VMware Secrets Manager Build Server

> **The VSecM Build Server Contains Trust Material**
> 
> The **VSecM** build server is a hardened and trusted environment
> with limited access. It contains trust material such as the
> Docker Content Trust root key, and the private key for signing
> the **VSecM** images.

We (*still*) have a manual build process, so you will need access to the
**VSecM** build server to be able to cut a release.

You can of course build **VSecM** locally, but without the build server, you
won‚Äôt be able to push the images to the registry and tag the release.

## Configuring Minikube Local Registry

Switch to the `$WORKSPACE/secrets-manager` project folder
Then, delete any existing minikube cluster.

```bash
cd $WORKSPACE/aegis
make k8s-delete
```

Then start the **Minikube** cluster.

```bash 
cd $WORKSPACE/aegis
make k8s-start
```

This will also start the local registry. However, you will need to
eval some environment variables to be able to use Minikube‚Äôs registry instead
of the local Docker registry.

```bash 
cd $WORKSPACE/secrets-manager
eval $(minikube docker-env)

echo $DOCKER_HOST
# example: tcp://192.168.49.2:2376
#
# Any non-empty value to `echo $DOCKER_HOST` means that 
# the environment has been set up correctly.
```

## Creating a Local Deployment

Follow these steps to build **Aegis** from scratch and deploy it to your
local **Minikube** cluster, to experiment it with your workloads.

```bash
# Temporarily disable Docker Content Trust 
# to deploy Minikube:
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=0

make k8s-delete
make k8s-start

# The environment has changed; re-evaluate 
# the environment variables:
eval $(minikube docker-env)

make build-local
make deploy-local
```

When everything completes, you should be able to see **VMware Secrets Manager** 
pods in the `vsecm-system` namespace.

```bash
kubectl get po -n vsecm-system

# Output should list `vsecm-safe` and `vsecm-sentinel`.
```

## Cutting a Release

Before every release cut, follow the steps outlined below.

### 1. Double Check

Ensure that all the changes have been merge to `main`.

Also make sure your `docker` and `Minikube` are up and running.

Additionally, execute `eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)` once more to
update your environment.

### 2. `make help`

Check the `make help` command first, as it includes important information.

### 3. Test VSecM Istanbul Images

**VMware Secrets Manager** Istanbul series use lightweight and secure 
distroless images.

```bash 
make k8s-delete
make k8s-start
eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)

# For macOS, you might need to run `make mac-tunnel` 
# on a separate terminal.
# For other Linuxes, you might need it.
#
# make mac-tunnel

make build-local
make deploy-local
make test-local
```

If the tests pass, go to the next step.

### 4. Test VSecM Photon (i.e. VMware Photon) Images

**VMware Secrets Manager** Photon series use [**VMware Photon OS**][photon] as 
their base images.

[photon]: https://vmware.github.io/photon/

```bash 
make k8s-delete
make k8s-start
eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)

# For macOS, you might need to run `make mac-tunnel` 
# on a separate terminal.
# For other Linuxes, you might need it.
#
# make mac-tunnel

make build-local
make deploy-photon-local
make test-local
```

### 5. Tagging

Tagging needs to be done **on the build server**.

There is no automation for this yet.

```bash
git checkout main
git stash
git pull
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
make tag
```

Follow the instructions, and you should be good to go.

### 6. All Set üéâ

You‚Äôre all set.

Happy releasing.
