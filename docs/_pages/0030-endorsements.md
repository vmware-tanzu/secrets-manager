Don't just take our word for it. See what industry experts
are saying about **VMware Secrets Manager** for Cloud-Native Apps.

> "This technology is the best I've seen to manage secrets end-to-end in a
> Kubernetes-native way. **VMware Secrets Manager** avoids the need to deploy
> and maintain external, non-cloud-native stores, which is a huge differentiator."
> 
> **-- Ramiro Salas, Staff Engineer, VMware**
{: .block-tip }

> "One more cloud native project that leverages SPIFFE for authentication!
> Woohoo! More SPIFFE!"
> 
> **-- Eli Nesterov, Co-founder of SPIRL**
{: .block-tip }

> "I've long wondered how we could radically re-make secrets management if
> SPIFFE was already in place. Wonder no longer!"
> 
> **-- Andrew Jessup, Director of Product Management, HPE Security Engineering**
{: .block-tip }

> "Secrets management is a relatively mature technology, however its role in the
> cloud native landscape has been dramatically evolving. **VMware Secrets Manager**
> is a ground-up re-imagination, solving the problem in a way that is congruent
> with the future of cloud computing."
> 
> **-- Evan Gilman, Author of Zero Trust Networks (O'Reilly),
> SPIRE core maintainer**
{: .block-tip }

> "With VMware Secrets Manager, dispatching my secrets in my infra is a breeze. It requires
> minimal effort to maintain, freeing me up to focus on more important tasks.
> In fact, it runs so smoothly that I sometimes forget it even exists.
> **VMware Secrets Manager** gives me peace of mind."
> 
> **-- Hamza Erbay, Staff Engineer, Udemy**
{: .block-tip }

> "**VMware Secrets Manager** is like a vault for your secrets, but instead of a
> big strong guy named Chuck guarding it, it is just some secure code."
> 
> **-- İlter Köse, Software Engineer, MOIA**
