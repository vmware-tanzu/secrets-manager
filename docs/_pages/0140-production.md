## Introduction

You need to pay attention to certain aspects and parts of the system that
you'd need to harden for a **production** *VMware Secrets Manager* setup.
This article will overview them.

## Version Compatibility

We test **VMware Secrets Manager** with the recent stable version of Kubernetes and Minikube.

As long as there isn't a change in the **major** version number your
Kubernetes client and server you use, things will likely work just fine.

## Resource Requirements

**VMware Secrets Manager** is designed from the ground up to work in environments with limited
resources, such as edge computing and IoT.

That being said, **VMware Secrets Manager**, by design, is a memory-intensive application.
However, even when you throw all your secrets at it, **VSecM Safe**'s peak
memory consumption will be in the order or 10-20 megabytes of RAM. The CPU
consumption will be within reasonable limits too.

However, it's crucial to understand that every system and user profile is unique.
Factors such as the number and size of secrets, concurrent processes, and system
specifications can influence these averages. Therefore, it is always advisable to
benchmark **VMware Secrets Manager** and **SPIRE** on your own system under your specific usage
conditions to accurately gauge the resource requirements to ensure optimal
performance.

Benchmark your system usage and set **CPU** and **Memory** limits to the
**VSecM Safe** pod.

We recommend you to:

* Set a memory **request** and **limit** for **VSecM Safe**,
* Set a CPU **request**; but **not** set a CPU limit for **VSecM Safe**
  (*i.e., the **VSecM Safe** pod will ask for a baseline CPU;
  yet burst for more upon need*).

As in any secrets management solution, your compute and memory requirements
will depend on several factors, such as:

* The number of workloads in the cluster
* The number of secrets **Safe** (*VMware Secrets Manager' Secrets Store*) has to manage
  (*see [architecture details][architecture] for more context*)
* The number of workloads interacting with **Safe**
  (*see [architecture details][architecture] for more context*)
* **Sidecar** poll frequency (*see [architecture details][architecture] for
  more context*)
* etc.

[architecture]: /docs/architecture

We recommend you benchmark with a realistic production-like
cluster and allocate your resources accordingly.

That being said, here are the resource allocation reported by `kubectl top`
for a demo setup on a single-node minikube cluster to give an idea:

```text 
NAMESPACE     WORKLOAD            CPU(cores) MEMORY(bytes)
vsecm-system  vsecm-safe          1m         9Mi
vsecm-system  vsecm-sentinel      1m         3Mi
default       example 2m         7Mi
spire-system  spire-agent         4m         35Mi
spire-system  spire-server        6m         41Mi
```

Note that 1000m is 1 full CPU core.

Based on these findings, the following resource and limit allocations can be
a starting point for **VMware Secrets Manager**-managed containers:

```yaml
  # Resource allocation will highly depend on the system.
  # Benchmark your deployment, monitor your resource utilization,
  # and adjust these values accordingly.
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "128Mi"
      cpu: "250m"
    limits:
      memory: "128Mi"
      # We recommend "NOT" setting a CPU limit.
      # As long as you have configured your CPU "requests"
      # correctly, everything would work fine.
```

## Back Up Your Cluster Regularly

**VMware Secrets Manager** is designed to be resilient; however, losing access to your sensitive
data is possible by inadvertently deleting a Kubernetes `Secret` that you are
not supposed to delete. Or, your backing store that contains the secrets can get
corrupted for any reason.

Cloud Native or not, you rely on hardware which--intrinsically--is unreliable.

Things happen. Make sure you back up your cluster [using a tool like
**Velero**][velero], so that when things do happen, you can revert your
cluster's last known good state.

> **Make Sure You Back Up `vsecm-root-key`**
> 
> The Kubernetes `Secret` names `vsecm-root-key` that resides in the 
> `vsecm-system` namespace is especially important, and needs to be 
> securely backed up.
>

> encrypted secret backups, and you will not be able to restore your secrets.
{: .block-warning }

**Set up your backups from day zero**.

[velero]: https://velero.io/ "Velero"

## Restrict Access To `vsecm-root-key`

The `vsecm-root-key` secret that **VSecM Safe** stores in the `vsecm-system`
namespace contains the keys to encrypt and decrypt secret data on the data
volume of **VSecM Safe**.

While reading the secret alone is not enough to plant an attack on the secrets
(*because the attacker also needs to access the VSecM Safe Pod or the `/data`
volume in that Pod*), it is still **crucial** to follow the **principle of least
privilege** guideline and do not allow anyone on the cluster read or write
to the `vsecm-root-key` secret.

The only entity allowed to have read/write (*but not delete*) access to
`vsecm-root-key` should be the **VSecM Safe** Pod inside the `vsecm-system`
namespace with an `vsecm-safe` service account.

Kubernetes Secrets are, by default, stored **unencrypted** in the API server's
underlying data store (`etcd`). Anyone with API access and sufficient RBAC
credentials can retrieve or modify a `Secret`, as can anyone with access
to `etcd`.

[config-ref]: /docs/configuration/ "Configuration Reference"

If you are **only** using **VMware Secrets Manager** for your configuration and 
secret storage needs, and your workloads do **not** bind any Kubernetes `Secret` 
(*i.e., instead of using Kubernetes `Secret` objects, you use tools like **VSecM SDK**
or **VSecM Sidecar** to securely dispatch secrets to your workloads*) then
as long as you secure access to the secret `vsecm-root-key` inside the
`vsecm-system` namespace, you should be good to go.

With the help of **VSecM SDK**, **VSecM Sidecar**, and **VSecM Init Container**,
and with some custom coding/shaping
of your data, you should be able to use it.

However, **VMware Secrets Manager** also has the option to[persist the secrets stored in
**VSecM Safe** as Kubernetes `Secret` objects][VSecM-k]. This approach can
help support **legacy** systems where you want to start using
**VMware Secrets Manager** without introducing much code and infrastructure change to the
existing cluster--at least initially.

[VSecM-k]: /docs/cli/#creating-kubernetes-secrets "VSecM Sentinel: Creating Kubernetes Secrets"

If you are using **VMware Secrets Manager** to generate Kubernetes `Secrets` for the workloads
to consume, then take regular precautions around those secrets,
such as [*implementing restrictive RBACs*][rbac], and even [considering using
a KMS to encrypt `etcd` at rest][kms] if your security posture requires it.

### **Do I Really Need to Encrypt `etcd`?**

#### tl;dr:

Using plain Kubernetes `Secret`s is good enough, and it is not the
end of the world if you keep your `etcd` unencrypted.

> **VMware Secrets Manager Keeps Your Secrets Safe**
>
> If you use **VMware Secrets Manager** to store your sensitive data, your secrets
> will be securely stored in **VSecM Safe** (*instead of `etcd`*),
> so you will have even fewer reasons to encrypt `etcd` 😉.

#### Details

This is an excellent question. And as in any profound answer to
good questions, the answer is: "*it depends*" 🙂.

`Secret`s are, by default, stored unencrypted in `etcd`. So if an adversary
can read `etcd` in any way, it's game over.

##### Threat Analysis

Here are some ways this could happen:

1. Root access to a control plane node.
2. Root access to a worker node.
3. Access to the actual physical server (*i.e., physically removing the disk*).
4. Possible zero day attacks.

For `1`, and `2`, server hardening, running secure Linux instances, patching,
and preventing privileged pods from running in the cluster are the usual ways
to mitigate the threat. Unfortunately, it is a relatively complex attack vector
to guard against. Yet, once your node is compromised, you have **a lot**
of things to worry about. In that case, `etcd` exposure will be just one of
many, *many*, **many** concerns that you'll have to worry about.

For `3`, assuming your servers are in a data center, there should already be
physical security to secure your servers. So the attack is **unlikely**
to happen. In addition, your disks are likely encrypted, so unless the attacker
can shell into the operating system, your data is already safe: Encrypting
`etcd` once more will not provide any additional advantage in this particular
case, given the disk is encrypted, and root login is improbable.

For `4.`, the simpler your setup is, the lesser moving parts you have, and the
lesser the likelihood of bumping into a zero-day. And Kubernetes `Secret`s
are as simple as it gets.

Even when you encrypt `etcd` at rest using a **KMS** (*which is the most robust
method proposed [in the Kubernetes guides][kms]*), an attacker can still
impersonate `etcd` and decrypt the secrets: As long as you provide the correct
encrypted DEK to KMS, the KMS will be more than happy to decrypt that DEK with
its KEK and provide a plain text secret to the attacker.

##### Secure Your House Before Securing Your Jewelry

So, **yes**, securing `etcd` will marginally increase your security posture.
Yet, it does not make too much of a difference unless you have **already**
secured your virtual infrastructure **and** physical data center. And
if you haven't secured your virtual and physical assets, then you are in big
trouble at day zero, even before you set up your cluster, so encrypting
`etcd` will not save you the slightest from losing other valuable data
elsewhere anyway.

##### Security Is a Layered Cake

That being said, we are humans, and $#!% does happen: If a node is compromised
due to a misconfiguration, it would be nice to make the job harder for the
attacker.

## Restrict Access to `vsecm-system` and `spire-system` Namespaces

Rigorously define and enforce access policies for the `vsecm-system` and
`spire-system` namespaces. These namespaces contain the **VSecM Safe** and
**SPIRE** components, respectively, and are critical to the security of
**VMware Secrets Manager**. Only a **Cluster Administrator** should have
access to these namespaces.

In addition, make sure you implement continuous monitoring and auditing
mechanisms to ensure that the access policies are not violated.

## Restrict Access to VSecM Sentinel

All **VMware Secrets Manager** images are based on [distroless][distroless] containers 
for an additional layer of security. Thus, an operator cannot execute a shell on the
Pod to try a privilege escalation or container escape attack. However, this does
not mean you can leave the `vsecm-system` namespace like an open buffet.

Always take a **principle of least privilege** stance. For example, do not let
anyone who does not need to fiddle with the `vsecm-system` namespace see and use
the resources there.

This stance is especially important for the **VSecM Sentinel** Pod since an
attacker with access to that pod can override (*but not read*) secrets on
workloads.

**VMware Secrets Manager** leverages Kubernetes security primitives and modern 
cryptography to secure access to secrets. And **VSecM Sentinel** is the **only** 
system part that has direct write access to the **VSecM Safe** secrets store. 
Therefore, once you secure access to **VSecM Sentinel** with [proper RBAC and
policies][rbac], you secure access to your secrets.


> **You Can Delete `vsecm-sentinel` When You No Longer Need It**
> 
> For an added layer of security and to reduce the attack surface, you can
> delete the `vsecm-sentinel` Pod after registering your secrets to **VSecM Safe**.

## Scaling SPIRE

**SPIRE** is designed to scale horizontally. This means that you can add more
**SPIRE Server** and **SPIRE Agent** instances to your cluster to increase
the capacity of your **SPIRE** deployment.

Although **VMware Secrets Manager** comes with a default SPIRE configuration,
depending on your deployment needs, you may need to scale SPIRE to meet your
specific requirements.

SPIRE supports:

* Horizontal scaling with multiple SPIRE server,
* Nested topologies to have separate failure domains,
* Federated deployments with multiple trust roots,
* And more.

Check out [Scaling SPIRE][scaling-spire] and [Extending SPIRE][extending-spire]
sections in the official SPIRE documentation for more information.

[scaling-spire]: https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/planning/scaling_spire/ "Scaling SPIRE"
[extending-spire]: https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/planning/extending/ "Extending SPIRE"

## Use of Attestation

In **VSecM**, the security of your secrets depends on the `ClusterSPIFFEID`s
that you assign to your workloads. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that
you specify proper attestors in your `ClusterSPIFFEID`s.

You can check the [SPIRE Documentation][spire-docs] and
also [VSecM Usage Examples][usage-examples] for examples on how to create
`ClusterSPIFFEID`s with proper attestors.

## SPIRE Configuration

**VMware Secrets Manager** uses [SPIRE][spire] as its underlying identity control 
plane. The default SPIRE configuration bundled with **VMware Secrets Manager**
is secure enough for most use cases. 

While **VSecM** uses sane defaults for SPIRE installation, it can be further 
hardened according to specific deployment needs, providing a more robust and 
secure environment.

Here are some suggestions to consider; as always, you should consult
the [SPIRE documentation][spire-docs] for more details.

[usage-examples]: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/secrets-manager/tree/main/examples "VSecM Usage Examples"

### Enabling Kubelet Verification

For ease of installation the **SPIRE Agent** is configured to trust all kubelets
by setting `skip_kubelet_verification` to `true` in the `agent.conf` file.

The `skip_kubelet_verification` flag is used when **SPIRE** is validating the 
identity of workloads running in Kubernetes.

Normally, **SPIRE** interacts with the kubelet API to verify the identity of a workload. 
This includes validating the serving certificate of the kubelet.
When `skip_kubelet_verification` is set to `true`, **SPIRE** does not validate 
the kubelet's serving certificate. This can be useful in environments where the 
kubelet's serving certificate is not properly configured or cannot be trusted for 
some reason.

That being said, skipping kubelet verification reduces security. It should be used 
cautiously and only in environments where the risks are understood and deemed 
acceptable.

To ensure kubelet verification is enabled:

* **Flag Setup**: Ensure the `skip_kubelet_verification` flag is either set to 
  `false` or omitted. 
  By default, if the flag is not specified, kubelet verification is enabled.
* **Kubelet Certificate**: Make sure the kubelet's serving certificate is properly 
  configured and trusted within your Kubernetes cluster. This may involve configuring 
  the Kubernetes cluster to issue valid serving certificates for kubelets.
* **Restart SPIRE Agent**: After making changes to the configuration, restart 
 the **SPIRE Agent** to apply the new settings.

> **Plan Carefully**  
>
> Remember, enabling kubelet verification might require updates to your cluster's 
> configuration and careful planning to avoid disruption to existing workloads.
{: .block-tip }

### Configuration Files

**SPIRE Server** and **SPIRE Agent** are configured using `server.conf` and 
`agent.conf` files, respectively. For Kubernetes deployments, these can be stored 
in `ConfigMaps` and mounted into containers. This ensures configuration consistency 
and ease of updating.

To secure these configuration files, you can:

* Use a `Secret` instead of a `ConfigMap` to store the configuration files.
* Encrypt `etcd` at rest using a **KMS** (*which is the most robust method
  proposed [in the Kubernetes guides][kms]*).
* **Audit Logs**: Enable and monitor audit logs to track access and changes to `ConfigMaps`. 
  This helps in identifying unauthorized access or modifications.
* **Regular Reviews and Updates**: Periodically review and update the access policies 
  and configurations to ensure they remain secure and relevant.
* **Minimize Configuration**: Only include necessary configuration settings in 
  `server.conf` and `agent.conf`. Avoid any sensitive data unless absolutely 
  necessary.

[spire]: https://spiffe.io/spire/
[spire-docs]: https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/

### Trust Domain Configuration

Set the `trust_domain` parameter in both server and agent `ConfigMaps`. This parameter 
is crucial for ensuring that all workloads in the trust domain are issued identity 
documents that can be verified against the trust domain's root keys.

### Port Configuration

The `bind_port` parameter in the server `ConfigMap` sets the port on which the 
**SPIRE Server** listens for **SPIRE Agent** connections. Ensure this port is 
securely configured and matches the setting on the agents.

### Node Attestation

Choose and configure appropriate Node Attestor plugins for both **SPIRE Server** and 
**SPIRE Agent**. This is critical for securely identifying and attesting agents. 

### Data Storage

For SPIRE runtime data, set the `data_dir` in both server and agent `ConfigMap`s. 
Use **absolute paths** in production for stability and security. 

Consider the choice of database for storing SPIRE Server data, especially in 
high-availability configurations. 

By default, SPIRE uses SQLite, but for production, an alternative SQL-compatible 
storage like MySQL can be a better fit.

### Key Management

**SPIRE** supports *in-memory* and *on-disk* storage strategies for keys and certificates. 

For production, the **on-disk** strategy may offer advantages in terms of persistence 
across restarts but requires additional security measures to protect the stored keys.

### Trust Root/Upstream Authority Configuration

Configure the `UpstreamAuthority` section in the server `ConfigMap`. 

This is pivotal for maintaining the integrity of the SPIRE Server's root signing 
key, which is central to establishing trust and generating identities.

### SPIRE Needs hostPath Access for SPIRE Agent DaemonSets

**SPIRE Agent** primarily uses `hostPath` for managing [Unix domain 
socket][unix-domain-socket]s on Linux systems. This specific usage is focused 
on facilitating communication between the **SPIRE Agent** and **workloads** 
running on the same host. 

The **Unix domain socket** used by the **SPIRE Agent** is typically configured 
to be read-only for workloads. This read-only configuration is an important 
security feature for several reasons:

* **Principle of Least Privilege**: Setting the Unix domain socket to read-only 
  for workloads adheres to the principle of least privilege. Workloads generally 
  only need to read data from the socket (*such as fetching SVIDs*) and do not 
  require write permissions. Limiting these permissions reduces the risk of 
  unauthorized actions.
* **Mitigating Risks of Tampering**: By making the socket **read-only** for 
  workloads, the risk of these workloads tampering with the socket's data or 
  behavior is minimized. This is crucial as SPIRE Agents deal with sensitive 
  identity credentials.
* **Reducing Attack Surface**: A **read-only** configuration limits the potential 
  actions an attacker can perform if they compromise a workload. 
* **Ensuring Data Integrity**: **Read-only** access helps ensure the integrity of 
 the data being transmitted through the socket. Workloads receive the data as 
 intended by the SPIRE Agent without the risk of accidental or malicious alteration.
* **Compliance with Security Best Practices**: This configuration aligns with 
 broader security best practices in systems design, where components are given only 
 the permissions necessary for their function, reducing potential vulnerabilities.

> requires additional permissions [you can follow SPIRE's official documentation][spire-openshift]
{: .block-tip }

[spire-openshift]: https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/deploying/spire_agent/#openshift-support
[openshift]: https://www.openshift.com/ "OpenShift"

To make the `hostPath` binding extra secure, you can:

* Use **Pod Security Admission** and custom **Admission Controllers** to restrict 
  the use of `hostPath` to certain paths and ensure that only authorized pods have 
  access to those paths.
* **Node-Level Security**: Ensure that the nodes themselves are secure. This includes 
  regular updates, patch management, and following best practices for host security. 
  Secure nodes reduce the risk of compromising the directories accessed through `hostPath`.
* **Network Policies**: Configure network policies to control the traffic to and from 
  the SPIRE Agent pods. This can limit the potential for network-based attacks 
  against the agents.
* **Regular Security Reviews**: Regularly review and update your security configurations. 
  This includes checking for updates in Kubernetes security recommendations and ensuring 
  your configurations align with the latest best practices.

[distroless]: https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless

### Further Security and Configuration Considerations

As in any distributed system, regularly monitor and audit **SPIRE** and **VSecM**
operations to detect any unusual or suspicious activity. This includes monitoring 
the issuance and use of `SVID`s, as well as the performance and status of the 
**SPIRE Server** and **SPIRE Agent*(s.

Regularly conduct security audits of your **SPIRE** deployment to identify and 
address any vulnerabilities. 

To reduce the blast radius in unlikely breaches, if needed, use a **nested 
topology** and **federated deployments** to segment failure domains and provide 
multiple roots of trust. 

## Keep the SPIRE Server Alive

This is more of a **stability** than a **security** concern; however, it is
important.

If **SPIRE Server** if offline for a long time then its root certificate will
expire. The expiry time of the root certificate is configurable, but by default
it's CA TTL is *24 hours*.

> **SPIRE Is Designed to Be Resilient**
> 
> Occasional disruptions, evictions, and restarts of SPIRE Server are not
> a problem. **SPIRE Server** is designed to be resilient and it will
> automatically recover from such disruptions.
> 
> However, if the **SPIRE Server** is offline for more than its TTL, then
> it will not be able to renew its root certificate, and this will disrupt
> the trust mechanism within the **SPIRE** environment.
{: .block-info }

Regarding the implications of the **SPIRE Server** being offline for more than
its TTL, it's important to understand the role of the server's CA certificate in
the SPIRE architecture:

The CA certificate is central to the trust establishment in the **SPIRE**
infrastructure. If the server is offline and unable to renew its CA certificate
before expiration, this will disrupt the trust mechanism within the SPIRE
environment. Agents and workloads will not be able to validate the authenticity
of new SVIDs issued after the CA certificate has expired, leading to trust and
authentication issues across the system.

> **Know Your TTLs**
> 
> Although **SPIRE** has sane defaults, it is still important to know your 
> tolerance and set TTLs (*both CA TTLs, and agent SVID TTLs*) accordingly. 
{: .block-warning }

From the **VMware Secrets Manager** perspective, this will result in workloads
not being able to receive secrets from the **VSecM Safe**, and the **VSecM Safe**
failing to respond to the requests made by the **VSecM Sentinel**.

Therefore, it's important to ensure that the **SPIRE Server** is online and able
to renew its CA certificate before it expires. Otherwise, manual intervention
will be required to fix the trust issue.

## Volume Selection for VSecM Safe Backing Store

[**VSecM Safe** default deployment descriptor][vsecm-safe-deployment-yaml]
uses [`HostPath`][k8s-pv] to store encrypted backups for secrets.

It is highly recommended to ensure that the backing store **VSecM Safe**
uses is **durable**, **performant**, and **reliable**.

It is a best practice to avoid `HostPath` volumes for production deployments.
You are strongly encouraged to [choose a `PersistentVolume` that suits your
needs][k8s-pv] for production setups.

[vsecm-safe-deployment-yaml]: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/secrets-manager/blob/main/helm-charts/charts/safe/templates/Deployment.yaml
[k8s-pv]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/

## High Availability of VSecM Safe

> **tl;dr:**
>
> **VSecM Safe** may not emphasize high-availability, but its robustness is
> so outstanding that the need for high-availability becomes almost negligible.
{: .block-tip}

Since **VSecM Safe** keeps all of it state in memory, using a pod with enough
memory and compute resources is the most effective way to leverage it. Although,
with some effort, it might be possible to make it highly available, the effort
will likely bring unnecessary complexity without much added benefit.

**VSecM Safe** is, by design, a single pod; so technically-speaking, it is
not highly-available. So in the rare case when **VSecM Safe** crashes, or
gets evicted due to a resource contention, there will be minimal disruption
until it restarts. However, **VSecM Safe** restarts fairly quickly, so the
time window where it is unreachable will hardly be an issue.

Moreover **VSecM Safe** employs "*lazy learning*" and does not load everything
into memory all at once, allowing **very** fast restarts. In addition, its
lightweight and focused code ensures that crashes are infrequent, making
**VSecM Safe** *practically* highly available.

While it is possible to modify the current architecture to include more than one
**VSecM Safe** pod and place it behind a service to ensure high-availability,
this would be a significant undertaking, with not much benefit to merit it:

First of all, for that case to happen, the state would need to be moved away
from the memory, and centralized into a common in-memory store (*such as Redis,
or etcd*). This will introduce another moving part to manage. Or alternatively
all **VSecM Safe** pods could be set up to broadcast their operations and reach
a quorum. A quorum-based solution would be more complex than using a share store,
besides reaching a quorum means a performance it (*both in terms of decision time
and also compute required*).

On top of all these bootstrapping coordination would be necessary to prevent
two pods from creating different bootstrap secrets simultaneously.

Also, for a backing store like Redis, the data would need to be encrypted
(*and Redis, for example, does not support encryption at rest by default*).

When considering all these, **VSecM Safe** has not been created highly-available
**by design**; however, it is so robust, and it restarts from crashes so fast that
it's "*as good as*" highly-available.

## DO NOT LIMIT CPU on VSecM Pods

**VSecM Safe** uses CPU resources only when it needs it. It is designed to be
lightweight and it does not consume CPU resources unless it needs to. So
unless you have a very specific reason to limit CPU on **VSecM Safe** pods,
it is recommended to let it burst when it needs.

Moreover, **VSecM Safe** is a go-based application. Limiting CPU on Go-based 
workloads can be problematic due to the nature of [Go's garbage collector 
(*GC*) and concurrency management][go-gc]. 


In Go, a significant portion of CPU usage can be attributed to the garbage collector 
(*GC*). It's designed to be fast and optimized, so altering its behavior is generally 
**not** recommended. 

Limiting CPU directly for Go-based workloads might not be the best approach due
to the intricacies of Go's garbage collection and concurrency model. And
**VSecM Safe** is no exception to this.

Instead, profiling it to understand its specific needs in your cluster and 
adjusting the relevant environment variables (like `GOGC` and `GOMAXPROCS`) can 
lead to better overall performance.

Having said that, please note that each cluster has its own characteristics
and this is not a one-size-fits-all recommendation. Kubernetes is a complex
machine and there are many factors that can influence the performance of

## Update VMware Secrets Manager's Log Levels

**VSecM Safe** and **VSecM Sidecar** are configured to log at `TRACE` level by
default. This is to help you debug issues with **VMware Secrets Manager**. However, this can
cause a lot of noise in your logs. Once you are confident that **VMware Secrets Manager**
works as expected, you can reduce the log level to `INFO` or `WARN`.

For this, you will need to modify the `VSECM_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
in the **VSecM Safe** and **VSecM Sidecar** Deployment manifests.

See [**Configuring VMware Secrets Manager**](/docs/configuration) for details.

## Conclusion

Since **VMware Secrets Manager** is a *Kubernetes-native* framework, its security is strongly
related to how you secure your cluster. You should be safe if you keep your
cluster and the `vsecm-system` namespace secure and follow
"*the principle of least privilege*" as a guideline.

**VMware Secrets Manager** is a lightweight secrets manager; however, that does not mean it
runs on water: It needs CPU and Memory resources. The amount of resources you
need will depend on the criteria outlined in the former sections. You can either
benchmark your system and set your resources accordingly. Or set generous-enough
limits and adjust your settings as time goes by.

Also, you are strongly encouraged **not** to set a limit on **VMware Secrets Manager** Pods' CPU
usage. Instead, it is recommended to let **VSecM Safe** burst the CPU when
it needs.

On the same topic, you are encouraged to set a **request** for **VSecM Safe**
to guarantee a baseline compute allocation.
