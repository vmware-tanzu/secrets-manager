## We Donâ€™t Track No Cookies

Wondering how this website fares when it comes to privacy and GDPR rules and
regulations? â€”Good news: It do not use any tracking cookies.

## Your Personal Data is Safe

We do not collect your data. Since we donâ€™t have your data, we cannot share your
data (*dâ€™uh*). However, to make lawyers happy, I want to reiterate that
we will never share your information with anyone without your prior consent.

> Also, I am determined to keep this website ad-free: So you can be sure that
> nothing about you will be shared with stupid third-party ad networks.
