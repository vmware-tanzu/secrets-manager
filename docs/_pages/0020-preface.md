## Hey, This Website Looks Like a GitBook 📖

Yes, this website is intentionally created like a book. We wanted to make
sure that you have a great experience reading our documentation, and we
believe that following the documentation cover-to-cover as if it were a book
is the best way to learn about **VMware Secrets Manager** (*VSecM*) for
Cloud-Native Apps.

We use a heavily customized version of [the Jekyll GitBook Theme][gitbook-theme]
to achieve this. [You can check the source code for this website on
GitHub][github] to see how that is done.

## Terminology: A Tale of Two Secrets

There are two kinds of “*secret*”s mentioned throughout this documentation:

* Secrets that are stored in **VSecM Safe**: When discussing these, they will
  be used like a regular word “secret” or, emphasized “**secret**”; however,
  you will never see them in `monotype text`.
* The other kind of secret is Kubernetes `Secret` objects. Those types
  will be explicitly mentioned as “*Kubernetes `Secret`s*” in the documentation.

We hope this will clarify any confusion going forward.
