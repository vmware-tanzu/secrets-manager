## Recent Updates

* We now have a Go-based integration test suite instead of the former bash-based
  one. This change makes the tests more reliable and easier to maintain, while
  we can leverage the Go language’s powerful primitives to make the tests
  readable, maintainable, and scalable.
* Documented all public methods in the codebase. This will help
  contributors to understand the codebase better and make it easier to
  contribute.
* VSecM components have sensible “memory” lower limits in helm charts (before
  it was left for the end-user to decide, now we provide a strarting point
  while encouraging the user to do their own benchmarks to update the 
  resource limits to their production needs.)

## [v0.23.0] - 2024-03-01

### Added

* VSecM Sentinel now waits for VSecM Safe to be ready before running init 
  commands.
* Documentation updates and code refactoring.
* Updated dependencies for better security.
* Updated Go version to 1.22.0--the latest stable version.

## [v0.22.5] - 2024-02-26

### Added

* Provisioned an public ECR registry to deploy and test VSecM on EKS.
* Added a GitHub Actions workflow to generate a test coverage badge, and
  coverage reports.
* Added the ability to use a persistent volume for VSecM Safe.

### Changed

* Bumped SPIRE Server and SPIRE Agent to the latest versions (1.9.0).
* VSecM Sentinel logs now have a correlation ID to make it easier to trace
  logs initiated by different requests.
* Improvements to the logging-and-auditing-related code.
* Deleting a VSecM Safe "secret" now also deletes the associated Kubernetes
  secret, if it exists.
* VSecM Safe now has a more robust retry strategy for creating and updating
  Kubernetes secrets.

## [v0.22.4] - 2024-02-17

### Added

* Added the ability to associate multiple namespaces with a single VSecM secret.
* Added a tombstone feature to VSecM Sentinel, so that when the init commands run to
  completion, they will not run again if VSecM Sentinel is evicted and restarted.
* Created an ECR repository to test edge versions of VSecM container images that
  have not been released yet.
* Added audit logging capabilities to VSecM Sentinel.

### Fixed

* Secrets creation now has a backoff policy and will retry if the first attempt fails.
* `VSECM_LOG_LEVEL` was left at `7` (verbose) in the charts, defaulting to `3` (warn).

### Changed

* Moved "*VMware, Inc.*" from the copyright headers, replacing it with "*VMware
  Secrets Manager contributors*".
* Default resource limits for Minikube initialization scripts to a more reasonable
  values for development. These are still configurable via environment variables.

### Security

* Fixed CVE-2024-25062 [When using the XML Reader interface with DTD validation 
  and XInclude expansion enabled, processing crafted XML documents can lead to 
  an xmlValidatePopElement use-after-free](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/secrets-manager/security/dependabot/10)

  direct access to the app's source code or deployment manifests.

## [v0.22.1] - 2024-01-11

### Added

* Added expiration and "invalid before" dates to secrets.

* Achieved great progress towards Open SSF Best Practices compliance; reaching
  93% of the requirements.
* Added ability to generate random secrets based on a pattern.
* Added ability to export encrypted secrets.

### Changed

* **BREAKING**: Certain environment variables are renamed to be more consistent
  with the rest of the project. The old variables are not supported anymore.
  check out the **configuration** section of the documentation for more details.
* Updated SPIRE, SPIRE Controller Manager, and SPIFFE CSI Driver to the latest
  versions.
* Moved older versions of the manifests to a `k8s` branch, and older snapshots
  of documentation to a `docs` branch to keep the `main` branch clean.

### Fixed

* Fixes on workflow scripts to have a more streamlined build process and
  development experience.
* Minor bugfixes and code enhancements.

## [v0.21.5] - 2023-12-18

### Changed

* **BREAKING**: Environment variables related to SPIFFEID are renamed from
  i.e. `VSECM_SENTINEL_SVID_PREFIX` to `VSECM_SENTINEL_SPIFFEID_PREFIX`.

### Added

* Documentation updates on security, production installation recommendations,
  and `kind` cluster usage for development.
* Minor code enhancements.

### Security

* Fixed CVE-2023-48795 [Russh vulnerable to Prefix Truncation Attack against ChaCha20-Poly1305 and Encrypt-then-MAC](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/secrets-manager/security/dependabot/9)

## [v0.21.4] - 2023-11-30

  bootstrapping keys if you want an extra level of security and control the
  creation of the root key.

## [v0.21.0] - 2023-09-08

### Added

* Documentation updates to make the project align with the current status of
  **VSecM**.
* Migrate existing Aegis documentation to the [new VMware Secrets Manager
  documentation site](https://vsecm.com).
* Updated [contributing guidelines](https://vsecm.com/docs/contributing) to make it easier for first-time
  contributors.
* Published a formal [project governance model](https://vsecm.com/docs/governance/).
* Added a [blog section](https://vsecm.com/docs/blog/) to the website.
* Decided to add a new helm chart per each release.
* Added instructional video content to the [showcase section](https://vsecm.com/docs/showcase/).

### Fixed

* Minor bugfixes after migration; ensuring feature and behavior parity with
  Aegis.
* Implemented stricter matchers for VSecM Sentinel and VSecM Safe's
  `Identity.yaml`s.

### Security

* Updated the [security policy](https://vsecm.com/docs/security/), clarifying
  our ideal response time for security vulnerabilities.
* Fixed a minor vulnerability in `activesupport` dependency:
  ([CVE-2023-38037](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-38037)).
  [fix](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/secrets-manager/pull/215);
  [dependabot](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/secrets-manager/security/dependabot/2).
  The vulnerability affects only the website build process, not the **VSecM**
  codebase itself. It is not exploitable in our case, but we still wanted to
  fix it.
