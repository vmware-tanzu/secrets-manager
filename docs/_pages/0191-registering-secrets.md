## Situation Analysis

As an operator, you may need to register secrets in VMware Secrets Manager
so that your applications can securely access them.

This use case is about how to register secrets in VMware Secrets Manager.

## Implementation

### Registering a Secret Using the CLI

To register a secret in VMware Secrets Manager, you can use the CLI as follows:

```bash 
# $SENTINEL is the name of VSecM Sentinel pod.
 kubectl exec "$SENTINEL" -n vsecm-system -- safe \
  -w "example-workload-demo" \
  -n "default" \
  -s 'TopSecret!#'
```

Note that you don't need to workload to be running to register a secret.

Here, `-w` is the workload name, `-n` is the namespace, and `-s` is the secret 
value.

Check out [the CLI reference](/docs/cli/) for more details.

### Registering a Secret Using VSecM Sentinel Init Commands

**VSecM Sentinel** can also register secrets using init commands.

The best way to do this is to specify the init command values in its
Helm chart values file.

Here is an example to register the same secret using the `initCommand` stanza
of `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
{% raw %}# ./charts/sentinel/values.yaml
initCommand:
  enabled: true
  command: |
    --
    w:example-workload-demo
    n:default
    s:gen:TopSecret!#
    --
{% endraw %}
```

There is a slightly-more-advanced "*init command*" example in 
[Mounting Kubernetes Secrets as Environment Variables][mounting-k8s-secrets] 
use case too.

## Conclusion

Successfully registering secrets in **VMware Secrets Manager** is essential for 
ensuring secure and efficient access to sensitive data by your applications. 

This guide provided two robust methods for registering secrets: 

* using the Command Line Interface (*CLI*) 
* and through VSecM Sentinel Init Commands. 

Each method offers a streamlined approach tailored to different operational 
preferences and requirements.

Using the CLI, operators have the flexibility to directly execute commands 
within the Kubernetes environment, enabling immediate and precise secret 
registration. This method is particularly useful for those who prefer hands-on, 
scriptable interactions with their infrastructure.

Alternatively, the VSecM Sentinel Init Commands method integrates secret 
registration directly into the deployment process, offering a more automated 
and error-resistant approach by leveraging Helm chart configurations. 
This is advantageous for environments where automation and scalability are 
priorities.

Both methods are supported by detailed documentation and examples, ensuring that 
you have the necessary resources to implement the solution that best fits your 
operational needs. 

By adopting these practices, you can enhance the security posture of your 
applications while maintaining a high level of operational efficiency.
