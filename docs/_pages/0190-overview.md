## Introduction

This section provides the necessary prerequisites for the upcoming tutorials,
as well as a high-level overview of the architecture. This information should
suffice to get you started and familiar with the basics.

## Prerequisites

To complete the tutorials listed here, you will need the following:

* A **Kubernetes** cluster that you have sufficient admin rights.
* **VMware Secrets Manager** up and running on that cluster.
* [The `vmware-tanzu/secrets-manager` repository][repo] cloned inside a workspace
  folder (such as `/home/WORKSPACE/secrets-manager`)

> **How Do I Set Up VMware Secrets Manager**?
>
> To set up **VMware Secrets Manager**, [follow the instructions in this quickstart guide][quickstart].

## Minikube Instructions

For your Kubernetes cluster, you can use [**minikube**][minikube] for development
purposes.

To use **minikube**, as your cluster, make sure you have
[**Docker**][docker] up and running first--while there are other ways, using
Minikube's Docker driver is the fastest and painless way to get started.

Once you have **Docker** up and running, execute the following script to
install **minikube**. Note that you will also need [`git`][git] and [`make`][make]
installed on your system.

```bash
# Switch to your workspace folder (e.g., `~/Desktop/WORKSPACE`).
cd $WORKSPACE
# Clone VMware Secrets Manager repository if you haven't already done so:
git clone https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/secrets-manager.git
# cd into the cloned project folder
cd secrets-manager
# Test if `make` is working, if it fails, install `make` first
make help 
# Install minikube
make k8s-start
```

> **Can I Use This Other Thing Instead**?
>
> You can of course use other tools such as [microk8s], or [kind], [k38][k3s]
> or even a full-blown managed Kubernetes cluster; however it will be virtually
> impossible to cover all possible tooling and OS combinations. Therefore,
> we'll only provide instructions for **minikube** in this document.

## High-Level Overview

Here is a high-level overview of various components that will interact with
each other in the upcoming tutorials:

![High-Level Overview](/assets/actors.jpg "High-Level Overview")

On the above diagram:

* **SPIRE** is the identity provider for all intents and purposes.
* **VSecM Safe** is where secrets are stored.
* **VSecM Sentinel** can be considered a bastion host.
* **Demo Workload** is a typical Kubernetes Pod that needs secrets.

> [You can check out this "**VMware Secrets Manager** Deep Dive" article][architecture]
> to learn more about these components.

[architecture]: /docs/architecture

The **Demo Workload** fetches secrets from **VSecM Safe**. This is either
indirectly done through a **sidecar** or directly by using
[**VMware Secrets Manager Go SDK**][go-sdk].

Using **VSecM Sentinel**, an admin operator or ar CI/CD pipeline can register
secrets to **VSecM Safe** for the **Demo Workload** to consume.

All the above workload-to-safe and sentinel-to-safe communication are
encrypted through **mTLS** using the **X.509 SVID**s that **SPIRE**
dispatches to all the actors.

After this high-level overview of your system, let's create a workload next.
