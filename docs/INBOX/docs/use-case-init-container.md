## Using **Aegis Init Container**

In certain situations you might not have full control over the source code
of your workloads. For example, your workload can be a containerized third
party binary executable that you don’t have the source code of. It might
be consuming Kubernetes `Secret`s through injected environment variables,
and the like.

Luckily, with **Aegis Init Container** you can interpolate secrets stored in
**Aegis Safe** to the `Data` section of Kubernetes `Secret`s at runtime to
be consumed by the workloads.

☝️ This sounds a bit mouthful. Fear not: Everything will be crystal clear 
after you go through this tutorial.

## Cleanup

Let’s remove our workload and its associated secret to start with a 
clean slate:

```bash
# Remove the workload deployment:
kubectl delete deployment example
# Find the sentinel pod’s name:
kubectl get po -n aegis-system 
# Delete the secret:
kubectl exec aegis-sentinel-778b7fdc78-86v6d -n \
  aegis-system -- aegis -w example -d
# Make sure that the secret is gone:
kubectl exec aegis-sentinel-778b7fdc78-86v6d -n \
  aegis-system -- aegis -l

{"secrets":[]}
```

## Read the Source

Make sure [you examine the manifests][workload-yaml] to gain an understanding
of what kinds of entities you’ve deployed to your cluster.

[workload-yaml]: https://github.com/shieldworks/aegis/tree/main/examples/workload-using-init-container/k8s

## Demo Workload

Here are certain important code pieces from the demo workload that we are 
going to deploy soon.

The following is the main application that the workload runs:

```go
// ./examples/workload-using-init-container/main.go

func main() {
    // … Truncated …
    
	for {
		fmt.Printf("My secret: '%s'.\n", os.Getenv("SECRET"))
		fmt.Printf("My creds: username:'%s' password:'%s'.\n",
			os.Getenv("USERNAME"), os.Getenv("PASSWORD"),
		)
		fmt.Println("")

		time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
	}
}
```

As you see, the code tries to parse several environment variables. But,
where does it get them?

For that let’s look into [`Deployment.yaml][deployment-yaml] manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: example
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: example
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: example
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: example
      containers:
      - name: main
        # Replace $version with the most recent version:
        image: aegishub/example-using-init-container:$version
        env:
          - name: SECRET
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: aegis-secret-example
                key: VALUE
          - name: USERNAME
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: aegis-secret-example
                key: USERNAME
          - name: PASSWORD
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: aegis-secret-example
                key: PASSWORD

# … Truncated  … 
```

In the deployment manifest, there are environment variable bindings from a
secret named `aegis-secret-example`.

Let’s [look into that secret too][secret-yaml]:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: aegis-secret-example
  namespace: default
type: Opaque
```

As you see, the secret doesn’t have any data associated with it. 
We will dynamically populate it using **Aegis Sentinel** soon.

[deployment-yaml]: https://github.com/shieldworks/aegis/blob/main/examples/workload-using-init-container/k8s/Deployment.yaml
[secret-yaml]: https://github.com/shieldworks/aegis/blob/main/examples/workload-using-init-container/k8s/Secret.yaml

## Deploy the Demo Workload

To begin, let’s deploy our demo workload:

```bash 
# Switch to the project folder:
cd $WORKSPACE/aegis
# Deploy the demo workload:
# Install the workload:
make example-init-container-deploy
# If you are building from the source, 
# use `make example-init-container-deploy-local` instead.
```

When we list the pods, you’ll see that it’s not ready yet because 
**Aegis Init Container** is waiting for a secret to be registered to this pod.

```bash
kubectl get po 

NAME                                   READY   STATUS     RESTARTS   AGE
example-5d8c6c4865-dlt8r   0/1     Init:0/1   0          49s
```

Here are the containers in that [`Deployment.yaml`][deployment-yaml]

```yaml
      containers:
      - name: main
        image: aegishub/example-using-init-container:$version
      
      # … Truncated  … 
      
      initContainers:
      - name: init-container
        image: aegishub/aegis-init-container:$version
```

It’s the `init-container` that waits until the workload acquires a secret.

## Registering Secrets to the Workload

To make the init container exit successfully and initialize the main
container of the Pod, execute the following script:

```bash
{% raw %}# ./examples/workload-using-init-container/register.sh

# Find a Sentinel node.
SENTINEL=$(kubectl get po -n aegis-system \
  | grep "aegis-sentinel-" | awk '{print $1}')

# Execute the command needed to interpolate the secret.
kubectl exec "$SENTINEL" -n aegis-system -- aegis \
-w "example" \
-n "default" \
-s '{"username": "root", "password": "SuperSecret", "value": "AegisRocks"}' \
-t '{"USERNAME":"{{.username}}", "PASSWORD":"{{.password}}", "VALUE": "{{.value}}"}' \
-k

# Sit back and relax.{% endraw %}
```

Here are the meanings of the parameters in the above command:

* `-w` is the name of the workload.
* `-n` identifies the namespace of the Kubernetes `Secret`.
* `-k` means **Aegis** will update an associated Kubernetes `Secret`.
* `-t` is the template to be be used to transform the fields of the payload.
* `-s` is the actual value of the secret.

Now let’s check if our pod has initialized:

```bash 
kubectl get po

NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
example-5d8c6c4865-dlt8r   1/1     Running   0          7m49s
```

It looks like it did. So, let’s check its logs:

```bash
kubectl logs example-5d8c6c4865-dlt8r

My secret: 'AegisRocks'.
My creds: username:'root' password:'SuperSecret'.

My secret: 'AegisRocks'.
My creds: username:'root' password:'SuperSecret'.

My secret: 'AegisRocks'.
My creds: username:'root' password:'SuperSecret'.
```

Which means, our secret should also have been populated; let’s check tha too:

```bash
kubectl get secret 

NAME                               TYPE     DATA   AGE
aegis-secret-example   Opaque   3      7h9m
```

```bash
kubectl describe secret aegis-secret-example

Name:         aegis-secret-example
Namespace:    default
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>

Type:  Opaque

Data
====
PASSWORD:  11 bytes
USERNAME:  4 bytes
VALUE:     10 bytes
```

And yes, the values have been dynamically bound to the secret.

## What Happened?

In summary, the `Pod` that your `Deployment` manages will not initialize until 
you register secrets to your workload.

Once you register secrets using the above command, **Aegis Init Container** will
exit with a success status code and let the main container initialize with the
updated Kubernetes `Secret`.

Here is a sequence diagram of how the secret is transformed (*open the image
in a new tab for a larger version*):

## A Video Is Worth a Lot of Words

You can also watch a demo video that implements the above flow. The video
visually explains the above concepts in greater detail:

## Conclusion

That’s how you can register secrets as environment variables to workloads and 
halt bootstrapping of the main container until the secrets are registered to
the workload.

This approach is marginally **less** secure, because it creates interim secrets
which are not strictly necessary if we were to use **Aegis Sidecar** or
**Aegis Safe**. It is meant to be used for **legacy** systems where directly
using the **Safe Sidecar** or **Safe SDK** are not feasible. 

For example, you might not have direct control over the source code to enable a 
tighter **Safe** integration. Or, you might temporarily want to establish 
behavior parity of your legacy system before starting a more canonical **Aegis** 
implementation.

For modern workloads that you have more control, we highly encourage you to
use [**Aegis SDK**][tutorial-sdk] or [**Aegis Sidecar**][tutorial-sidecar] instead.

That being said, it’s good to have this option, and we are sure you can find
other creative ways to leverage it too.

Next, we’ll learn how to encrypt secrets for safe storage.
