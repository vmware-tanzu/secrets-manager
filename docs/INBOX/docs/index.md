## What Is **Aegis**?

[**Aegis**][aegis] is a cloud-native secure store for secrets management.
It provides a minimal and intuitive API, ensuring practical security without
compromising user experience. 

Endorsed by industry experts, **Aegis** is a ground-up re-imagination of
secrets management, leveraging [**SPIRE**](https://spiffe.io/) for 
authentication and providing a cloud-native way to manage secrets end-to-end.

**Aegis** is resilient and secure by default,
storing sensitive data in memory and encrypting any data saved to disk.

With **Aegis**, you can rest assured that your sensitive data is always 
**secure** and **protected**. 

## Where Can I Use **Aegis**?

**Aegis** is perfect for securely storing arbitrary configuration information at a 
central location and securely dispatching it to workloads, offering 
*centralized* and *secure* secrets store for your clusters.

By leveraging Kubernetes security primitives, [**SPIRE**][spire], and strong,
industry-standard encryption, **Aegis** ensures that your secrets are **only** 
accessible to **trusted** and **authorized** workloads. **Aegis**‚Äôs 
Cloud Native‚Äîsecure by default‚Äîfoundation helps you safeguard your business 
and protect against data breaches.

## Terminology: A Tale of Two Secrets

There are two kinds of ‚Äú*secret*‚Äùs mentioned throughout this documentation:

* Secrets that are stored in **Aegis Safe**: When discussing these, they will
  be used like a regular word ‚Äúsecret‚Äù or, emphasized ‚Äú**secret**‚Äù; however,
  you will never see them in `monotype text`.
* The other kind of secret is Kubernetes `Secret` objects. Those types
  will be explicitly mentioned as ‚ÄúKubernetes `Secret`s‚Äù in the documentation.

We hope this will clarify any confusion going forward.

## Wait, What‚Äôs Wrong With Kubernetes `Secret`s?

Kubernetes `Secret`s have legitimate use cases; however,
the out-of-the-box security provided by Kubernetes `Secret`s might not always
meet the stringent security and flexibility demands of modern applications.

In the Kubernetes ecosystem, the handling of secrets is facilitated through a 
specialized resource known as a `Secret`. The `Secret` resource allows Kubernetes 
to manage and store key-value pairs of sensitive data within a designated 
namespace in the cluster.

Kubernetes `Secrets` can be widespread across the cluster into various namespaces
which makes the management and access control to them tricky. In addition, 
when you update a Kubernetes `Secret` it is hard to make the workloads be aware 
of the change. Moreover, due to namespace isolation, you cannot define a cluster-wide
or cross-cluster-federated secrets: You have to tie your secrets to a single 
namespace, which, at times, can be limiting.

## The **Aegis** Difference

Cloud-native secret management can be more secure, centralized, and easy-to-use.
This is where **Aegis**, comes into play: 

> **Aegis** offers a *secure*, *user-friendly*, *cloud-native* secrets store that‚Äôs 
> robust yet *lightweight*, requiring almost zero DevOps skills for installation
> and maintenance.

In addition, **Aegis**‚Ä¶

* Has the ability to change secrets dynamically at runtime without having to
  reboot your workloads,
* Keeps encrypted backups of your secrets,
* Records last creation and last update timestamps for your secrets,
* Has a version history for your secrets,
* Stores backups of your secrets encrypted at rest,
* Enables GoLang transformations on your secrets,
* Can interpolate your stored secrets onto Kubernetes `Secret`s,
* Enables federation of your secrets across namespaces and clusters,
* and more.

These are not achievable by using Kubernetes `Secret`s only.

## Where **NOT** to Use Aegis

**Aegis** is **not** a Database, nor is it a distributed caching layer. Of course,
you may tweak it to act like one if you try hard enough, yet, that is
generally not a good use of the tool.

**Aegis** is suitable for storing secrets and dispatching them; however, it
is a *terrible* idea to use it as a centralized database to store everything
but the kitchen sink.

Use **Aegis** to store service keys, database credentials, access tokens,
etc.

## How Do I Get the Root Token? Where Do I Store It?

Unlike other ‚Äú*vault*‚Äù-style secrets stores, **Aegis** requires no admin token 
for operation‚Äîa clear advantage that lets your Ops team `#sleepmore` due to 
automation and eliminates manual unlocking after system crashes.

However, there‚Äôs no free lunch, and as the operator of a production system,
your homework is to secure access to your cluster. [Check out the **Production 
Deployment Guidelines**][production] for further instructions about hardening 
your cluster to securely use **Aegis**.

[production]: /production

## Installation

First, ensure that you have sufficient administrative rights on your 
**Kubernetes** cluster. Then create a workspace folder 
(*such as `$HOME/Desktop/WORKSPACE`*) and clone the project.
And finally execute `./hack/deploy.sh` as follows.

```bash 
mkdir $HOME/Desktop/WORKSPACE
export $WORKSPACE=$HOME/Desktop/WORKSPACE

./hack/deploy.sh
```

## Verifying the Installation

To verify installation, check out the `aegis-system` namespace:

```bash
kubectl get deployment -n aegis-system

# Output:
#
# NAME             READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE
# aegis-safe       1/1     1            1
# aegis-sentinel   1/1     1            1
```

That‚Äôs it. You are all set ü§ò.

## Uninstalling Aegis

Uninstallation can be done by running a script:

```bash 
cd $WORKSPACE/aegis 
./hack/uninstall.sh
```
