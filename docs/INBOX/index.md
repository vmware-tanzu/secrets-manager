## üéâ Important Announcement: Aegis is Transitioning to VMware Secrets Manager for Cloud-Native Apps üéâ

Dear Aegis Community,

I am excited to announce that Aegis, your trusted open-source project for secrets 
management, is transitioning to a new home under VMware‚Äôs umbrella, with the new 
name ‚Äú*VMware Secrets Manager for Cloud-Native Apps*‚Äù 
(*or Secrets Manager for short*).

This decision was not made lightly, but it is the best step forward for our 
community. Under VMware, the project will gain increased visibility, robust 
support, and a thriving ecosystem to accelerate its growth. 

<p style="background: #edc910; color: #000000;padding:1em;margin:1em 0 1em 0;">
Rest assured, <strong>the project will remain open-source</strong>, and I 
(<em>Volkan √ñz√ßelik</em>) will continue to serve as the core maintainer.</p>

Here‚Äôs what to expect in the coming weeks:

1. We will continue contributing to the current Aegis repository
   (<https://github.com/shieldworks/aegis>) and synchronizing it with the 
   private VMware repository. During this period, we will modify the code and rename 
   instances of ‚ÄúAegis‚Äù as ‚ÄúVMware Secrets Manager.‚Äù
2. The public repo will be synchronized with the private repo under VMware‚Äôs GitHub.
3. Our documentation website (<https://aegis.ist/>) will undergo name and branding 
   changes. While the content will remain the same, you may notice differences in 
   the theme and references to ‚ÄúVMware Secrets Manager for Cloud-Native Apps‚Äù 
   instead of Aegis.
4. The documentation GitHub repository (<https://github.com/shieldworks/aegis-web/>) 
   will be merged into the main repository (<https://github.com/shieldworks/aegis>) 
   to expedite the transition.
5. Once the code is ready, we will submit it for VMware Open Source‚Äôs due 
   diligence and implement any changes based on their feedback.
6. Upon completing these steps, the project under VMware will become open to 
   public contribution. We will then archive the existing repositories with a 
   note directing users to the current code at VMware‚Äôs GitHub.

To ensure a seamless transition, we will continue to publish artifacts to 
DockerHub during this process.

We are grateful for your support and understanding during this transition. 

This move will give Aegis the resources to grow and serve our community better. 

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

During this process, I‚Äôll be transparent and inform you using various channels 
I have used.

Best Regards,

Volkan √ñz√ßelik

Core Maintainer, Aegis
