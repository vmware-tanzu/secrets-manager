## Introduction

You need to pay attention to certain aspects and parts of the system that 
you‚Äôd need to harden for a **production** *Aegis* setup.
This article will overview them.

## Version Compatibility

We test **Aegis** with the recent stable version of Kubernetes and Minikube.

As long as there isn‚Äôt a change in the **major** version number your
Kubernetes client and server you use, things will likely work just fine.

## Resource Requirements

**Aegis** is designed from the ground up to work in environments with limited 
resources, such as edge computing and IoT.

That being said, **Aegis**, by design, is a memory-intensive application. 
However, even when you throw all your secrets at it, **Aegis Safe**‚Äôs peak 
memory consumption will be in the order or 10-20 megabytes of RAM. The CPU 
consumption will be within reasonable limits too.

However, it‚Äôs crucial to understand that every system and user profile is unique. 
Factors such as the number and size of secrets, concurrent processes, and system 
specifications can influence these averages. Therefore, it is always advisable to 
benchmark **Aegis** and **SPIRE** on your own system under your specific usage 
conditions to accurately gauge the resource requirements to ensure optimal 
performance.

Benchmark your system usage and set **CPU** and **Memory** limits to the
**Aegis Safe** pod.

We recommend you to:

* Set a memory **request** and **limit** for **Aegis Safe**,
* Set a CPU **request**; but **not** set a CPU limit for **Aegis Safe** 
  (*i.e., the **Aegis Safe** pod will ask for a baseline CPU;
  yet burst for more upon need*).

As in any secrets management solution, your compute and memory requirements
will depend on several factors, such as:

* The number of workloads in the cluster
* The number of secrets **Safe** (*Aegis‚Äô Secrets Store*) has to manage
  (*see [architecture details][architecture] for more context*)
* The number of workloads interacting with **Safe**
  (*see [architecture details][architecture] for more context*)
* **Sidecar** poll frequency (*see [architecture details][architecture] for 
  more context*)
* etc.

[architecture]: /docs/architecture

We recommend you benchmark with a realistic production-like
cluster and allocate your resources accordingly.

That being said, here are the resource allocation reported by `kubectl top`
for a demo setup on a single-node minikube cluster to give an idea:

```text 
NAMESPACE     WORKLOAD            CPU(cores) MEMORY(bytes)
aegis-system  aegis-safe          1m         9Mi
aegis-system  aegis-sentinel      1m         3Mi
default       example 2m         7Mi
spire-system  spire-agent         4m         35Mi
spire-system  spire-server        6m         41Mi
```

Note that 1000m is 1 full CPU core.

Based on these findings, the following resource and limit allocations can be
a starting point for **Aegis**-managed containers:

```text
  # Resource allocation will highly depend on the system.
  # Benchmark your deployment, monitor your resource utilization,
  # and adjust these values accordingly.
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "128Mi"
      cpu: "250m"
    limits:
      memory: "128Mi"
      # We recommend ‚ÄúNOT‚Äù setting a CPU limit.
      # As long as you have configured your CPU ‚Äúrequests‚Äù
      # correctly, everything would work fine.
```

## Back Up Your Cluster Regularly

**Aegis** is designed to be resilient; however, losing access to your sensitive 
data is possible by inadvertently deleting a Kubernetes `Secret` that you are 
not supposed to delete. Or, your backing store that contains the secrets can get 
corrupted for any reason. 

Cloud Native or not, you rely on hardware which‚Äîintrinsically‚Äîis unreliable.

Things happen. Make sure you back up your cluster [using a tool like 
**Velero**][velero], so that when things do happen, you can revert your 
cluster‚Äôs last known good state.

**Set up your backups from day zero**.

## Restrict Access To `aegis-safe-age-key`

The `aegis-safe-age-key` secret that **Aegis Safe** stores in the `aegis-system` 
namespace contains the keys to encrypt and decrypt secret data on the data
volume of **Aegis Safe**.

While reading the secret alone is not enough to plant an attack on the secrets
(*because the attacker also needs to access the Aegis Safe Pod or the `/data`
volume in that Pod*), it is still **crucial** to follow the **principle of least
privilege** guideline and do not allow anyone on the cluster read or write
to the `aegis-safe-age-key` secret.

The only entity allowed to have read/write (*but not delete*) access to
`aegis-safe-age-key` should be the **Aegis Safe** Pod inside the `aegis-system` 
namespace with an `aegis-safe` service account.

> It is worth noting that a **Cluster Administrator** due to their elevated

Kubernetes Secrets are, by default, stored **unencrypted** in the API server‚Äôs 
underlying data store (`etcd`). Anyone with API access and sufficient RBAC
credentials can retrieve or modify a `Secret`, as can anyone with access 
to `etcd`.

If you are **only** using **Aegis** for your configuration and secret storage
needs, and your workloads do **not** bind any Kubernetes `Secret` (*i.e., 
instead of using Kubernetes `Secret` objects, you use tools like **Aegis SDK** 
or **Aegis Sidecar** to securely dispatch secrets to your workloads*) then 
as long as you secure access to the secret `aegis-safe-age-key` inside the
`aegis-system` namespace, you should be good to go.

With the help of **Aegis SDK**, **Aegis Sidecar**, and **Aegis Init Container**,
and with some custom coding/shaping of your data, you should be able to use it.
[Even when you don‚Äôt have direct access to the application‚Äôs source code, there
are still ways to inject environment variables without Kubernetes `Secret`s 
or `ConfigMap`s][david-copperfield].

[david-copperfield]: https://github.com/shieldworks/aegis/issues/231

However, **Aegis** also has the option to [persist the secrets stored in
**Aegis Safe** as Kubernetes `Secret` objects][aegis-k]. This approach can 
help support **legacy** systems where you want to start using 
**Aegis** without introducing much code and infrastructure change to the
existing cluster‚Äîat least initially.

[aegis-k]: https://aegis.ist/docs/sentinel/#creating-kubernetes-secrets "Aegis Sentinel: Creating Kubernetes Secrets"

If you are using **Aegis** to generate Kubernetes `Secrets` for the workloads
to consume, then take regular precautions around those secrets,
such as [*implementing restrictive RBACs*][rbac], and even [considering using
a KMS to encrypt `etcd` at rest][kms] if your security posture requires it.

### **Do I Really Need to Encrypt `etcd`?**

#### tl;dr: 

Using plain Kubernetes `Secret`s is good enough, and it is not the 
end of the world if you keep your `etcd` unencrypted.

> **Aegis Keeps Your Secrets Safe**
> 
> If you use **Aegis** to store your sensitive data, your secrets
> will be securely stored in **Aegis Safe** (*instead of `etcd`*), 
> so you will have even fewer reasons to encrypt `etcd` üòâ.
 
#### Details

This is an excellent question. And as in any profound answer to 
good questions, the answer is: ‚Äú*it depends*‚Äù üôÇ.
 
`Secret`s are, by default, stored unencrypted in `etcd`. So if an adversary
can read `etcd` in any way, it‚Äôs game over.

##### Threat Analysis

Here are some ways this could happen:
 
1. Root access to a control plane node.
2. Root access to a worker node.
3. Access to the actual physical server (*i.e., physically removing the disk*).
4. Possible zero day attacks.

For `1`, and `2`, server hardening, running secure Linux instances, patching, 
and preventing privileged pods from running in the cluster are the usual ways
to mitigate the threat. Unfortunately, it is a relatively complex attack vector 
to guard against. Yet, once your node is compromised, you have **a lot**
of things to worry about. In that case, `etcd` exposure will be just one of 
many, *many*, **many** concerns that you‚Äôll have to worry about.

For `3`, assuming your servers are in a data center, there should already be
physical security to secure your servers. So the attack is **unlikely**
to happen. In addition, your disks are likely encrypted, so unless the attacker
can shell into the operating system, your data is already safe: Encrypting
`etcd` once more will not provide any additional advantage in this particular
case, given the disk is encrypted, and root login is improbable.
 
For `4.`, the simpler your setup is, the lesser moving parts you have, and the 
lesser the likelihood of bumping into a zero-day. And Kubernetes `Secret`s 
are as simple as it gets.
 
Even when you encrypt `etcd` at rest using a **KMS** (*which is the most robust
method proposed [in the Kubernetes guides][kms]*), an attacker can still 
impersonate `etcd` and decrypt the secrets: As long as you provide the correct 
encrypted DEK to KMS, the KMS will be more than happy to decrypt that DEK with 
its KEK and provide a plain text secret to the attacker.

##### Secure Your House Before Securing Your Jewelry

So, **yes**, securing `etcd` will marginally increase your security posture.
Yet, it does not make too much of a difference unless you have **already** 
secured your virtual infrastructure **and** physical data center. And 
if you haven‚Äôt secured your virtual and physical assets, then you are in big 
trouble at day zero, even before you set up your cluster, so encrypting 
`etcd` will not save you the slightest from losing other valuable data 
elsewhere anyway.

##### Security Is a Layered Cake

That being said, we are humans, and $#!% does happen: If a node is compromised
due to a misconfiguration, it would be nice to make the job harder for the 
attacker.

## Restrict Access to Aegis Sentinel

All **Aegis** images are based on [distroless][distroless] containers for an
additional layer of security. Thus, an operator cannot execute a shell on the 
Pod to try a privilege escalation or container escape attack. However, this does 
not mean you can leave the `aegis-system` namespace like an open buffet.

Always take a **principle of least privilege** stance. For example, do not let 
anyone who does not need to fiddle with the `aegis-system` namespace see and use 
the resources there.

This stance is especially important for the **Aegis Sentinel** Pod since an
attacker with access to that pod can override (*but not read*) secrets on
workloads.

**Aegis** leverages Kubernetes security primitives and modern cryptography
to secure access to secrets. And **Aegis Sentinel** is the **only** system 
part that has direct write access to the **Aegis Safe** secrets store. Therefore, 
once you secure access to **Aegis Sentinel** with [proper RBAC and 
policies][rbac], you secure access to your secrets.

## Volume Selection for Aegis Safe Backing Store

[**Aegis Safe** default deployment descriptor][aegis-safe-deployment-yaml]
uses [`HostPath`][k8s-pv] to store encrypted backups for secrets.

It is highly recommended to ensure that the backing store **Aegis Safe**
uses is **durable**, **performant**, and **reliable**.

It is a best practice to avoid `HostPath` volumes for production deployments.
You are strongly encouraged to [choose a `PersistentVolume` that suits your 
needs][k8s-pv] for production setups.

## High Availability of Aegis Safe

> **tl;dr:**
> 
> **Aegis Safe** may not emphasize high-availability, but its robustness is 
> so outstanding that the need for high-availability becomes almost negligible.

Since **Aegis Safe** keeps all of it state in memory, using a pod with enough
memory and compute resources is the most effective way to leverage it. Although,
with some effort, it might be possible to make it highly available, the effort
will likely bring unnecessary complexity without much added benefit.

**Aegis Safe** is, by design, a single pod; so technically-speaking, it is
not highly-available. So in the rare case when **Aegis Safe** crashes, or
gets evicted due to a resource contention, there will be minimal disruption
until it restarts. However, **Aegis Safe** restarts fairly quickly, so the 
time window where it is unreachable will hardly be an issue.

Moreover **Aegis Safe** employs ‚Äú*lazy learning*‚Äù and does not load everything
into memory all at once, allowing **very** fast restarts. In addition, its 
lightweight and focused code ensures that crashes are infrequent, making
**Aegis Safe** *practically* highly available.

While it is possible to modify the current architecture to include more than one
**Aegis Safe** pod and place it behind a service to ensure high-availability,
this would be a significant undertaking, with not much benefit to merit it:

First of all, for that case to happen, the state would need to be moved away
from the memory, and centralized into a common in-memory store (*such as Redis,
or etcd*). This will introduce another moving part to manage. Or alternatively
all **Aegis Safe** pods could be set up to broadcast their operations and reach
a quorum. A quorum-based solution would be more complex than using a share store,
besides reaching a quorum means a performance it (*both in terms of decision time
and also compute required*).

On top of all these bootstrapping coordination would be necessary to prevent
two pods from creating different bootstrap secrets simultaneously.

Also, for a backing store like Redis, the data would need to be encrypted
(*and Redis, for example, does not support encryption at rest by default*).

When considering all these, **Aegis Safe** has not been created highly-available
**by design**; however, it is so robust, and it restarts from crashes so fast that
it‚Äôs ‚Äú*as good as*‚Äù highly-available.



## Update Aegis‚Äô Log Levels

**Aegis Safe** and **Aegis Sidecar** are configured to log at `TRACE` level by
default. This is to help you debug issues with **Aegis**. However, this can
cause a lot of noise in your logs. Once you are confident that **Aegis**
works as expected, you can reduce the log level to `INFO` or `WARN`.

For this, you will need to modify the `AEGIS_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
in the **Aegis Safe** and **Aegis Sidecar** Deployment manifests.

See [**Configuring Aegis**](/docs/configuration) for details.

## Conclusion

Since **Aegis** is a *Kubernetes-native* framework, its security is strongly
related to how you secure your cluster. You should be safe if you keep your 
cluster and the `aegis-system` namespace secure and follow 
‚Äú*the principle of least privilege*‚Äù as a guideline.

**Aegis** is a lightweight secrets manager; however, that does not mean it
runs on water: It needs CPU and Memory resources. The amount of resources you
need will depend on the criteria outlined in the former sections. You can either
benchmark your system and set your resources accordingly. Or set generous-enough
limits and adjust your settings as time goes by.

Also, you are strongly encouraged **not** to set a limit on **Aegis** Pods‚Äô CPU
usage. Instead, it is recommended to let **Aegis Safe** burst the CPU when 
it needs.

On the same topic, you are encouraged to set a **request** for **Aegis Safe**
to guarantee a baseline compute allocation.
