# Aegis Has a New Home

We are excited to announce that [**Aegis** has moved to **VMware Tanzu**
GitHub organization][new-aegis], where it will continue its journey under a
new name: [**VMware Secrets Manager for Cloud-Native Apps**][new-aegis].

This move is part of our effort to consolidate our projects and provide
better support and development speed. Under VMware, the project will gain
increased visibility, robust support, and a thriving ecosystem to
accelerate its growth.

**As a result of this transition, this repository is now archived and will no
longer be maintained**. All the active issues and pull requests will be migrated
to the new repository. [If you have any issues that have not been migrated,
feel free to open them in the new repository][new-aegis].

Please note that the core functionality remains the same, though under
the new organization and project name. Any future updates and enhancements
will be carried out in the new repository.

[For all future activities, please follow the new repository][new-aegis].
