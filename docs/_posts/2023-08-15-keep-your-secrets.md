## Introducing VMware Secrets Manager

In the ever-evolving landscape of cloud-native applications, secrets management
is critical to ensuring sensitive information's security and integrity. While
several solutions are available, the recent shift in Hashicorp's licensing towards
a Business Source License (*BSL*) has raised concerns and sparked discussions
within the community.

As the lead architect of [**VMware Secrets Manager** (**_VSecM_**)](https://vsecm.com/),
I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce our solution, which offers a robust,
flexible, and **permissive** alternative to Hashicorp's Vault.

## A New Licensing Landscape

Hashicorp's decision to adopt a Business Source License has been viewed by some
as a restrictive move. The BSL, unlike open-source licenses, imposes certain
limitations and conditions that may not align with the needs and values of all
organizations and developers.

In contrast, VMware Secrets Manager is licensed under the BSD 2-Clause License,
a permissive open-source license that encourages collaboration, innovation,
and freedom of use.

## VMware Secrets Manager: A Closer Look

**VSecM** is designed with modern developers and DevOps professionals in mind.
Here's why it stands out:

* **Ease of Use**: With a [**Quickstart Guide**](https://vsecm.com/docs/quickstart/),
  intuitive [**CLI**](https://vsecm.com/docs/cli/?ref=zerotohero.dev), and
  developer-friendly [**SDK**](https://vsecm.com/docs/sdk/), **VSecM**
  simplifies secrets management without compromising security.
* **Kubernetes Is a First-Class Citizen**: **VSecM** seamlessly integrates with
  Kubernetes, leveraging [**SPIRE**](https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/spire-about/)
  for authentication and offering flexible secret storage and transformation options.
* **Community Engagement**: We believe in open collaboration and community-driven
  development. Our [**Contributing Guide**](https://vsecm.com/docs/contributing/)
  invites developers to get involved, ask questions, and contribute to the project.
* **Secure by Default**: **VSecM** offers advanced security features, including
  encryption, manual root secret setting, and integration with various backing
  stores.
