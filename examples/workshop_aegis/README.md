## VMware Secrets Manager Workshop

This workshop is designed to help you get started with VMware Secrets Manager. 
It will walk you through the installation of VMware Secrets Manager and its 
components, and then demonstrate how to use VMware Secrets Manager to protect 
your secrets.

## A Video Is Worth a Lot of Words

[You can watch this demo video][video] as a shortened version of the workshop.

Note that the video is about the older version of VMware Secrets Manager,
called 'Aegis', but the concepts are the same. Also note that in the meantime
we have added a few more features to **VMware Secrets Manager**, so you will
find differences between the video and the current version of **VMware Secrets
Manager**.

In the video, we use all the scripts and resource manifests you see in this
folder to demonstrate various **VMware Secrets Manager** use cases.
