# Things to Do

## Assumptions

0. Remove federation configuration from the servers; ClusterFederatedTrustDomain
   is to create the federation anyway. // DID NOT WORK; will figure out later.

1. Install VSecM in all clusters (because weâ€™ll need it anyway).

2. Edge Nodes can have a keypair securely delivered to them out-of-band;
   likely around build time.
   The bundle will have a private/public key pair, and the public key of the
   control plane.

3. Control plane can create the keypair and store it in a secure place (like
   an object store within the network boundary; or a secret manager).
   (maybe we should have VSecM installed there to store the encryption keys
   to the key pairs, and store the encrypted key pairs in the object store?)

4. Edge node establishes an mTLS connection with a service on the control plane.

5. Edge node sends its trust bundle to the control plane.

6. In response the control plane sends the trust bundle of the control plane
   to the edge node.

7. Both sides save the trust bundles.

8. Both nodes register trust bundles to SPIRE servers, and also create the
   necessary custom resources.
