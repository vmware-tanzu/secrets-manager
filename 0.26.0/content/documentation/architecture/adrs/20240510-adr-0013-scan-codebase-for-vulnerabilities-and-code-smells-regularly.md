title = "ADR-0013: Scan the Codebase for Vulnerabilities and Code Smells Regularly"
weight = 13
+++

- Status: draft 
- Date:  2024-05-12
- Tags: security, static-analysis, quality

## Context and Problem Statement

As our software project grows in complexity and scale, the risk of introducing 
security vulnerabilities and code smells increases. Currently, our codebase 
lacks a consistent and systematic approach to identifying these issues early 
in the development cycle, leading to higher maintenance costs and potential 
security breaches in production.

This ADR is in a draft state, we will update it with a selection of tools and
processes to scan the codebase for vulnerabilities and code smells regularly.
