This folder contains reusable modules that can be used in multiple projects. 

If a code or module in the project is general enough to be used as a utility
in other projects, it should be moved to this folder.

This way, we can create a library of useful, independent modules, and even
move them out-of-tree to a separate repository if they become large enough
for the benefit of the community.
