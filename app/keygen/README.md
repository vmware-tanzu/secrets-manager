## VMware Secrets Manager (VSecM) Keygen

**VSecM Keygen** is a utility application that generates VSecM Safe's 
bootstrapping keys if you want an extra level of security and control the
creation of the **root key** yourself (*instead of letting VSecM Safe generate
it for you*).

This is useful for **manual** operation mode of **VSecM Safe** where it will
remain locked until you manually unlock it by providing the necessary keys.

Check out more details in the [official documentation](https://vsecm.com/).
