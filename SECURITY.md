## About

This document outlines the security policy and procedures for reporting
security vulnerabilities in **VMware Secrets Manager**, along with the 
version support policy.

## Supported Versions

Only the most recent version of **VMware Secrets Manager**
is currently being supported with security updates.

Note that **VMware Secrets Manager** consists of more than a single project,
and during a release cut, all projects are signed and tagged
with the same version.

After **VMware Secrets Manager** hits a major 1.0.0. version, this will change,
and we will also have a support plan various major versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Send your vulnerability reports to [security@vsecm.com](mailto:security@vsecm.com).

We don't have an official turnover time, but if nobody gets back
to you within a week please send another email.

We take all vulnerability reports seriously, and you will be notified 
if your report is accepted or declined, and what further actions we are going
to take on it.
